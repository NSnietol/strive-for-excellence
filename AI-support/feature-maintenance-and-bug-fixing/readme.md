# Code explanation

The initial step in modifying the existing functionality within a software is to examine and digest the code carefully.

```markdown
Please explain the logic and flow of the next code snippet. Provide a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works, highlighting any important algorithms or design patterns used.
Code snippet: {{the code  that requires explanation}}
Functionality: {{the functionality that the code snippet is responsible for}}
```


## The Q&A Pattern
Inline tools can sometimes provide interactive communication following a pattern where we ask a question using a specific format and the tool responds with an answer. This pattern is useful for understanding the logic and flow of a code snippet.

```markdown
//Q: {{the question}}
//A: {{the answer}}
```

## Implementing Changes. Modifying Functions or Methods

```markdown
I need to update this function/method: {{the function/method}}. The function/method currently behaves like this: {{the current behavior}}. Modification description : {{the desired behavior}}.
Also, please consider the following information:
- input and output : {{the input and output of the function/method}}
- Specific changes : {{the specific changes that need to be made}}
- Additional information : {{any additional information that may be useful}}
Given these details, can your provide recommendations and insights to guide us through the process of modifying the function/method?
```

## Debugging and fixing bugs

```markdown
I'm encountering an issue in my code that requires fixing. Here are the details:
- Issue description: {{the issue}}
- Code snippet: {{the code snippet}}
- Expected behavior: {{the expected behavior}}

Could you please provide guidance on how to debug and fix the issue?
