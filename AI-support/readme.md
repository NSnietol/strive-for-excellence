 ## Artificial Intelligence
 Is a term for machines that can simulate human intelligence, focuses on creating system that can perform tasks that require human intelligence.
  - Machine learning (ML): A subset of AI that focuses on detecting patterns and making decisions based on data.
  - Deep learning : A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to make decisions based on data.
  - Natural language processing (NLP) : A subset of AI that focuses on understanding and processing human language.
  - Large Language Models (LLM): A subset of NLP that focuses on understanding and generating human language.
  
## Large Language Models (LLM)
Parameters to evaluate LLMs:

- Number of parameters
- Model size
- Cost of training
- Performance after training

## Types of AI

- Discriminative AI : this model is a good at identifying distinctions between different classes of data for instance image recognition.
- Generative AI : this model is good at generating new data that is similar to the training data.
