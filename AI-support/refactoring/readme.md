# Refactoring 
## Best practices
- Focus on specific concerns: mention the aspect of the factoring you need help with such code duplication, simply logic.
- Request comparison : When inquiring about different refactoring techniques, it is helpful to ask for a comparison of the methods.
- Simplify complex prompts : When asking for help with a complex refactoring task, it is helpful to simplify the prompt by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks.


## Identifying code smells
Code smells indicate potential issues in your code that may require refactoring

```markdown
Please review the following code snippet in {{programming language}} and identify any code smells or areas in need of refactoring. This code is part of a {{brief description of the project}} and is responsible for {{the functionality of the code}}. Let me know if you need any additional information.
Code snippet: {{the code snippet}}
```
