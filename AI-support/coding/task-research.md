# Task Research with ChatGPT

To perform a task effectively, the problem must be understood completely. Keep in mind these points:

 - Functional aspects : the essential task requirements ( task and problem statement)
 - Components : the fundamental code blocks or modules


Here is a generalized template you can work with:

```markdown
I'm about to [perform a task] for a development task. The task involves [functional aspects] and [describe the specific goal of question relate to the action]. 
```


## Task decomposition
Once the the task is understood, the next phase is to decompose the task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. This can be done by:

 - Breaking down the task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
 - Create a hierarchy of tasks and sub-tasks.
 - Specific dependencies between tasks and sub-tasks.

This functionality looks great for planning unknown task to get a better understanding of the scope we could attach to it. Let's imagine we are in a planning meeting and we are discussing the scope of the project. We could use this to get a better understanding of the scope of the task.

for example:

```markdown
I'm about to start working on a development task. The task involves adding a "Recovering a Forgotten Password" feature to a web application. Currently, users cannot reset their passwords if they have forgotten them. Before I begin implementation, I want to ensure I understand the task and its requirements.
```
Can be the prompt to get the understanding of the scope of the task.


## Creating a new feature 
When creating a new feature, it is important to understand the requirements and the scope of the feature. This can be done by:

 - Defining a clear problem statement
 - Be specific
 - Adopt an iterative approach
 - Collaborate

### Create a new function or method

Here is one template for creating a new function or method:

```markdown
Please generate [function's purpose] that takes [input parameters] as input and returns [output parameters] as output. The method should follow these requirements: [specific requirements, key steps].
```

Example prompt:

```markdown
Generate a Java method that implements bubble sort. The method should accept a list of strings and return a sorted list.
```

### Create a new class 
Here is one template for creating a new class or module:

```markdown
Generate [the class/service name and purpose].This should have attributes like [key attributes or methods]. It should include [interaction with other classes or service]. Ensure the class follows the [desired design pattern or architectural style].
```

### Create new module 

Here is one template for creating a new module:

```markdown
As a [programming language] developer, I need assistance creating a new module/project for [purpose or functionality]. This module/project should integrate [frameworks or libraries]. Please provide initial code structure, including the necessary classes methods and relevant design patterns
```
