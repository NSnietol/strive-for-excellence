# Testing Quadrants

Testing Quadrants is a classification of the different types of tests that can be performed on a software application. The classification is based on the purpose of the test and the target audience. 

Agile Testing Quadrants provide a structured framework to categorize testing types, ensuring that your testing efforts align with your projectâ€™s specific needs. This focus leads to more efficient testing and better test coverage.

The four quadrants are:
- **Quadrant 1 (Q1):** Technology-facing tests that support the team(development) (e.g., unit tests, component tests, integration tests).
- **Quadrant 2 (Q2):** Business-facing tests that support the team, basically shift to business rules verification (e.g., functional tests, simulations, prototypes).
- **Quadrant 3 (Q3):** Business-facing tests that critique the product, user oriented( e.g., usability tests, exploratory tests, alpha/beta testing).
- **Quadrant 4 (Q4):** Technology-facing tests that critique the product (e.g performance testing, security testing, stress testing).
