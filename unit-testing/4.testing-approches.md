# The classicist school 

Defines shared (  are shared between tests and provide a means for tests to affect each otherâ€™s execution flow, e.g., a database, file system, etc.) and private types of dependencies and states that only shared dependencies should be replaced with test doubles. You can still use various types of test doubles, but only for dependencies that introduce a shared state between tests.

# The classicist school 
It's common practice in the mockist school to mock every dependency (except immutable dependencies) to provide the benefits of better isolation and granularity. 

The key differences between the classicist and mockist schools of unit testing stem from different approaches to isolation, unit size, and the use of test doubles and are best summarized in the table below.

### Plus of Classicist
Low coupling between tests and implementation details allows you to have flexibility in design refactoring

### Minutes
With the classicist school, it is harder to detect which exact method or class contains a bug after a test failure.



### Plus of Mockist
Tests are fine-grained and check only one class at a time.


### Minutes
Depicts a unit as a class, you don't test the unit's behavior, but the implementation details inside the class.
