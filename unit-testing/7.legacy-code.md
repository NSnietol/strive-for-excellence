"You can refactor safely only after all the business logic has been covered by high-quality 
unit tests. These tests ensure that the code still works correctly and nothing is broken."


* Step 1. Identify Change Points ; performed in small iterations, change points should be a function or a few functions in a single class.
* Step 2. Determine Test Points ;  Think about side effects
* Step 3. Break Dependencies ; apply the dependency inversion principle and redesign your code to comply with it.
* Step 4. Write Unit Tests ; Use characterization test describes the actual behavior of a piece of code.
* Step 5. Make Changes and Refactor
