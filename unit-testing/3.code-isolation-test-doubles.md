# Code Isolation and Test Doubles

One piece of code should not know about another piece of code or affect it in any way, in other words, If *A* uses *B*, it should not know where *B* came from or where *B* is going.

### The SOLID principles 
Are principles of clean design that enable code to be written in isolation.â€¯They aim to reduce dependencies and allow engineers to work with one piece of code without affecting the rest of the code.


## Test double

Is anything that replaces a production entity in a test scenario. Depending on their goal, test doubles can be divided into five types: dummy, fake, stub, spy, and mock.

* Dummy objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill parameters lists.(E.g LogServices)
* Fake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes the not suitable for production (E.g An inMemoryTestDatabase, Repository).
* Stub is a hardcoded object used to provide predefined responses every time specific methods are called. Stubs have predefined, controlled behavior; in other words, **every time a stub is called, it returns the same value.**
* Spy is a stub that also record some information based on they were called. 
* A mock is an object programmed for expected interactions. It focuses on verifying interactions with an object rather than its state.


 There is a difference between **stub**, whichs uses state verification while the **mock** uses behavior verification.
