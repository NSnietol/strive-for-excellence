# Unit testing

Is a software development process during which the smallest testable parts of an applications are collectively and independently assessed for operability.

A unit test is a method that tests a unit of behavior represented by an individual class or a function/procedure/method.

## Scope of unit testing

- Core business logic methods / functions
- High-risk services
- Utility methods and algorithms

  **DO NOT**
- Procedures that don't contain any validations ( E.g Models).
- Configuration (e.g constants, read-only fields, configs, enumerations).
- Private methods / functions directly.
- Database queries or multi-threading code.


## Benefits
- Enable safe refactors
- Find bugs quickly and easly
- Save time and money 
- Provide code documentation for developers.


## The FIRST principle of Writting Unit Test

- Fast 
- Isolate & Independent 
- Repeatable : must be deterministic.
- Self-validation : clearly indicates whether it passes or failed
- Thorought and timely
