# Mutation Testing

Is a type of software testing in which you change specific components of an app's source code to check whether a test suite can detect the changes.

These mutations are intended to cause behavior deviations in the program. Some of the mutations that can be used are :
* Delete a statement
* Duplicate or insert a statement
* Negate Boolean subexpressiones
* Replicate some arithmetic opeartions with others
* Replace Boolean relations with different ones
* Replicate variables with other form the same scope(must be compitable)
* Remove the body of a method.


## Automation is key to achieve this labor with ease

In Java, [Pitest](https://github.com/pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin) is a tool to consider when it comes to mutation testing.

# Plus and minus  

Advantages
- Detects weaks tests 
- Identifies errores accurately
- Evaluates test quality using mutation score

Disadvantanges

- Extremely time-consuming and pricey, givng the huge number of mutations tested
