# Indicators of technical debt

In fact, no single metric can tell the whole story about technical debt. The solution is to look for red flags that indicate technical debt is becoming a potential hindrance. Such indicators include quality metrics and non-measurable indicators.

- Code complexity : it's a sure sign of growing technical debt
- Code churn : Code that is rewritten or deleted shortly after being written
- Bug bounce : The rate of bugs being discovered is higher than the rate of bugs being resolved,
- Unplanned work
- Failed builds
- Cycle time
- Ticket volume

Using a single metric does not give you a full picture of how the project is going.
