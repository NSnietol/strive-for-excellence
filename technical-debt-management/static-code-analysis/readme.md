# Static code analysis

SCA aims to find programming errors, coding standard violations, and security vulnerabilities

## Other forms of CSA

- Software composition analysis : Identifies open-source components and their licenses
- Static application security testing : Identifies security vulnerabilities in the source code

### Two categories of tools can help you conduct SCA:

- Formatters : is a tool that automatically formats your code to a specific style guide.
- Linters : is a tool that analyzes source code to find issues in order to help improve it.
