# Technical debt

Technical debt refers to additional costs incurred in the future due to the choice of less optimal or incorrect technical solutions during the development process or costs that arise in existing code as software evolves.

It can be described as the effort needed to fix issues that arise from choosing an easy or quick solution over a better one. This can lead to increased maintenance costs, reduced productivity, and decreased quality of the software.

## Technical debt decomposition :

- Debt : Initial design flaws, lack of documentation, lack of test coverage, and code complexity.
- Interest : Maintenance costs, bug fixing, and additional time spent on development.

Although a defect itself is not technical debt, the debt can be related to a defect.
A quick patch that works around rather than fixes a high-priority defect is a frequent source of technical debt.


## Is Technical Debt Necessarily Negative?
While technical debt in a project is unavoidable, it can be strategically useful for generating revenue early on and can be addressed later. The key to differentiating beneficial technical debt from the burdensome kind is the strategy and reasoning behind it.



## Classification of Technical Debt

- Intentional: Deliberate decisions to take on technical debt to meet a deadline or to release a product quickly.
- Unintentional: Is introduced when you don't know in advance that making a certain decision will lead to technical debt.


Intentional technical debt prioritizes business needs over technology choices. It can be used beneficially to obtain prompt user feedback, secure necessary investments, enter a rapid growth market, and present a minimum viable product (MVP) to stakeholders.


## Types of Technical Debt Based on Its Nature
According to this classification, technical debt falls into the following categories:

- Code debt
- Maintenance debt
- Architecture debt
- Development efficiency debt
- Stability debt
- Security debt
- Decision debt

## Cause of Technical Debt

- Limited time 
- Lack of experienced developers
- Unjustified use of technologies : including using a technology that is not suitable for the project's requirements
- Lack of automated tests
- Outdated technologies
- Poor leadership : Insufficient project management can lead to technical debt, as developers may have to constantly shift between tasks and leave some unfinished.
- Lack of documentation : Lack of knowledge sharing process.

## Risk of ignoring technical debt

### Risks for developers
- More bugs created
- Bad coding habits developed by following bad practices
- Burnout due to frustration
- Low performance caused by having to dig through a lot of code to find the right place to make changes.


  
### Risks for the business
- Increased maintenance costs
- Security vulnerabilities
- Additional infrastructure expenses

### Risks for the project
- Lower morale when forced to work with legacy code
- Blame-shifting culture
- Employee attrition
- Low team performance 


## Conclusion

- Regularly allocate time for addressing technical debt to reduce its impact
- Communicate the importance of addressing technical debt to avoid negative consequences
