# Managing Technical Debt in Large-Scale Systems

## Lehman's Laws of Software Evolution
When building large-scale software systems, you have to balance different forces and challenges. On the one hand, you continuously adapt and evolve your codebase, but on the other, introducing those changes increases code complexity.



## Hotspot analysis
Is a technique that involves producing cluster visualizations of code complexity and change frequency to prioritize technical debt.


- Measure the complexity of the code : low cohesion, deeply nested logic, bumpy road code smell.
- Measure the code change frequency.

## Prioritizing Technical Debt
Not all technical debt needs to be fixed. Every codebase contains code that's rarely—if ever—used. Your work should be focused on fixing the most complex code that is changed most often.


## Offboarding Analysis
Is a cluster visualization technique used to identify risks associated with developers leaving a project and define areas of the code that may need a new main developer.
