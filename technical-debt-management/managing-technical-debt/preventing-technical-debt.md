# Preventing and Dealing With Technical Debt

It requires a collaborative effort across all levels of the organization to prevent technical debt, from top management to individual developers. Here are some key levels where work should be done to prevent technical debt:

- Project level
- Team level
- Individual level


## Project level

This approach should include the following practices:

### Establish a comprehensive strategy for managing technical debt
It is most beneficial to create a clear strategy at the beginning of the project.

### Define Governance Structure
Establish roles, responsibilities, decision-making processes, and policies to ensure structured and consistent software development and maintenance.


### Align technical debt with business goals
Ensure that efforts to manage technical debt are aligned with the organization's business objectives and goals

### Foster a culture of technical excellence 
Establish a culture that values and encourages technical excellence. Prioritize code quality, automated testing, and continuous improvement.

### Invest in infrastructure and tools
Support continuous integration and delivery by investing in automation, code analysis tools, and infrastructure

### Use agile methodologies.

## Team level

Managing technical debt on the team level requires a coordinated effort from all team members to ensure that software is developed and maintained sustainably. 


### Collaborate with stakeholders
### Integrate metrics
### Use automation
### Set up Quality Gates
### Manage dependencies 
### Maintain a knowledge base
### Isolate external services and devices


## The Individual (Engineering) Level
Once you have implemented team-level practices to prevent technical debt, focusing on individual-level efforts is crucial. At this level, engineers can prevent technical debt by adhering to coding standards and best practices, writing clean and maintainable code, continually learning and staying updated on industry trends, and actively participating in code reviews to ensure high code quality.
