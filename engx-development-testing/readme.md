## Shift-left testing
Involves moving software testing toward the early phases of the SDLC. The objective of shift-left testing is to get early feedback about a product's quality and resolve issues as soon as possible.


Benefits of shift-left testing:
- Lower project costs : The earlier you find a bug, the cheaper it is to fix it.
- Higher product quality.
- Reduced time to market: QA Process can be faster.
- Better customer satisfaction: The product is more stable and reliable.

Risks of pushing testing to the later stage:

- longer timeframes and scope:  More things to test and changes of overlooking something.
- Cost increases : often the software must be shipped back.
- Deadlines and budget limits rarely allow devs to fix everything towards the end of the project.
