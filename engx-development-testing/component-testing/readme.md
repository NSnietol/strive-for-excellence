# Component Testing
"A component test is a test that limits the scope of the exercised software to a portion of the system under test."  Martin Fowler


## Defining Components
The definition of "component" is somewhat relative. What characterizes a component will vary based upon your system architecture, available technologies, and testing aims.

- System Architecture 
- User Functionality : Their value-added activity
- Program Functionality : Deployable chunk of an application
- Organizational Norms and Practices.


Use test automation frameworks to standardize tools and workflows. The framework you choose will depend on factors such as cost, usability, scalability, and resilience.
