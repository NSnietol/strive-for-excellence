BDD fosters transparent communication through upfront collaboration and design among product owners/enablers, developers, and SDETs/testersâ€”a group called the Three Amigos.

In Agile software development and testing, a shift-left approach helps teams and organizations save time and money by moving validation and verification activities as far to the left of the development pipeline as possible.




BDD bridges the gap in understanding between an organization's business and technical teams by generating common documentation that everyone can refer to, that guides development and testing, and that results in software that precisely meets the needs of the user as outlined by the business expert.
