# Phases of BDD


* Design and definition: determining and decomposing the MVP and defining acceptance criteria and scenarios
* Formulation: creating and executing feature files and automating acceptance tests
* Delivery: releasing to production


## Design and Definition
The team defines the testable attributes of a product at the earliest stage of product management and product decomposition.

- Describe the Epic and its features
- Provide Gherkin Background
- Develop mainstream scenario : It's  end-to-end sequential/behavioral steps of product use from a user perspective.
- Write Scenarios
- Identify Product Metrics / KPIs
- Define Design and Acceptance Criteria : May be UI/UX, performance, security, Governance, etc.
- Break down and prioritize user stories.
  
## Formulation
The team creates and executes feature files and automates acceptance tests. it's important to define serious 
of test examples to provide good coverage of the feature.

## Delivery
The team releases to production. The team can use the same feature files to test the product in production.

Acceptance scenarios are the driving force of dynamic product decomposition that also serve as acceptance tests. As a result, BDD enables accurate documentation of requirements and zero-defect code through the red-green-refactor approach.


There are two primary options for BDD Implementation:

Manual without a BDD tool
Automated with a BDD tool
The option your team chooses will impact your toolset and the steps you take to begin implementation.
