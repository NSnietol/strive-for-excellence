# Test Data Management
The practice of constructing, managing, and delivering true-to-life test data for non-production testing purposes.


You can build a TDM strategy based on the type of data requirements in the project. This strategy can be in the form of the following:

* SQL queries that extract data from multiple tables in the databases
* Flat files based on mapping rules, simple modification, or desensitizing of production data or files
* An intelligent combination of both above


## Types of Test Data
- Production test data : this one needs sanitization and masking before use
- Synthetic test data : this one is generated by a tool or manually


### Synthetic Test Data
Is data that is artificially manufactured rather than generated by actual events. It can be found in different flavors:

- Wrong : inappropriate data to test the system's ability to handle errors
- Boundary : data that is on the edge of the acceptable range
- Valid : data that is within the acceptable range
- Absent : data that is missing
- Invalid : data that is outside the acceptable range


## Comparing Test Data Types

### Production Test Data

#### Pros
- test data looks and behaves like real data
- can be use to reflect complex system logic
- provides the most comprehensive test coverage

#### Risks

- Resources : requires tools may not be available
- Security : cloning production data may be a security risk
- Stale data : test data must be refreshed regularly to expose new bugs


### Testing type by test level:

- Unit testing : Synthetic test data should be use for lower-level testing
- Component/Contract testing : Hybrid test data should be use for component testing 
- E2E testing : Production test data should be use for E2E testing



## Key Test Data Management Features

- Data masking
- Data subsetting
- Data refresh
- Data provisioning
- Data Quality and Coverage
- Knowledge Management
- Integration,Data access and Monitoring
- Self-service portal



## Test Data Management Workflow
The workflow follows these three main steps:

* Identify test data requirements.
* Apply test generation strategies.
* Load, update, and clean up the test data.


## Test Data Management Maturity levels


- Level 1 : Defined
- Level 2 : Managed
- Level 3 : Optimized
