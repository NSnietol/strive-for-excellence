# Test Strategy and Test plan
*High value areas should be covered first every time you are testing.*


A test strategy is a high-level document that describes the approach to testing. It is a plan for **how** testing will be conducted. The test strategy is usually developed by the project manager or QA lead.

A test plan is a detailed document that describes the approach to testing. It is a plan for **what** testing will be conducted. The test plan is usually developed by the QA lead or test manager.

In real business cases, test strategies and test plans provide different focuses for team members—test strategies set general expectations about the software testing process, and test plans make these processes come to life with more specific details

While these documents may seem similar, they have some fundamental differences. One document derives from another, creating the following hierarchy—from the most foundational and broad document to the most specific:

* Test strategy
* Test plan
* Test development
    1. Test cases
    2. Test scenarios
    3. Test scripts
    4. Test automation

# Definition

## Test strategy
Presents the recommended approach to test the target-test and it will answer the following questions:

What testings types will be in scope.
How they will be performed, combined and optimized.
How testing will be organized into the phases.

Your test strategy document should be a concise and clear summary of the approach to testing you have chosen. Before creating the document, carefully analyze your product and its specific features and requirements, to suggest the most suitable testing approach for the project.
### Sections of the Test Strategy

* Scope of testing [Mandatory]
* Testing requirements
* Acceptance criteria [Mandatory]
* List of test types [Mandatory]
* Test types implementation details
* Defect Management
* Test phases [Mandatory]
* Test automation
* Test environments
* Test data management
* Test tools
* Risks

1. Product risk / specific features

What is the purpose of the product
Who are the users and how they will use the product?
Will it have sensitive data?
Platform supported?
Integrations?

2. Scope of work

What is really important?
Discuss what should be covered by our testing?
Start describing what is in scope and what is out of scope.


## Test Plan
shapes the software testing process. It focuses on resources your team needs to implement a test strategy for a particular application or release. It is a blueprint that defines the scope of the testing and the a definition of done for a release/project, contains information about all responsible parties and states what test types and testing levels should be applied.
