# Knowledge Base
A knowledge base is more than just a collection of information. It's like a smart system that helps you find what you're looking for easily. It has a search bar, a menu to navigate through different topics, and lots of categories to organize the content.

## Benefits of a knowledge base:
- Increase productivity
- Error reduction
- Training and onboarding improvement
- Retention of knowledge

## How to structure knowledge base
- Tree structure : It's like a tree with branches and leaves. The main topics are the branches, and the subtopics are the leaves.
- Graph structure : It's like a network of interconnected nodes. Each node is a topic, and the connections are the relationships between them.
- Mixed structure : It's a combination of the tree and graph structures. It's like a tree with some branches connected to each other.
