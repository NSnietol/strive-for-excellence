# Useful Knowledge

Useful knowledge includes not only factual information but also the ability to apply that information in various contexts. Useful knowledge can be considered synonymous with applicable knowledge.

## Project Knowledge vs Product Knowledge
 Project knowledge and product knowledge are two different types of knowledge that are essential for project success and product development. Project knowledge focuses on work processes and environments, while product knowledge is associated with specific quality characteristics of a product. By understanding the different types of knowledge and their applications, individuals and organizations can leverage knowledge to achieve their goals and drive success.

 ## Structure Approach
 - Plain text
 - Video
 - Q&A session
 - Diagram
 - Images
  
Some people can better digest specific types of information, therefore, we need to consider :

- Audience: who is the intended recipient of the knowledge?
- Frequency of information changes
- Available resources.

Information can be identified as common data, specific knowledge and mixed information.

## Maintaining Project Knowledge

In agile methodology, maintaining project knowledge is a shared responsibility among all team members. Rather than assigning specific roles or responsibilities, agile teams work collaboratively to ensure that everyone has access to the latest information and knowledge.


## Documenting Changes
Whenever changes are made to the project knowledge, it's important to document these changes. This could include changes to project requirements, updates to the project schedule, or changes to the project scope.
