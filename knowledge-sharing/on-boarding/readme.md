A successful onboarding experience is a great way to maintain high team member retention rates and reduce the need for frequent check-ins during regular workflows. 

Rather than treating project onboarding as a one-time event, it is essential to shift towards making it an ongoing, continuous experience.

The team member goes through a checklist of things that introduce them to their role within the team.

### Orientation
In this phase, people transition into the new role with good support from the existing team members and co-workers.

### Transition
The person will transit from the training phase to the regular workflow ( fully experienced team member), the goal is to thrive in their role and continue improving their skills.
