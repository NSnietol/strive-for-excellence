# CV Pre screening Guide

1) Review and analyze the candidate's profile and match the provided CV to the position requirements, the target role, or the job description.
2) Make a general overview of the CV structure and its sections: 
- Current relevance of the most recent employment.
- Eligibility of the candidate's education level.

3) Conduct a preliminary assessment of the candidate's level based on the responsibilities described in the CV.

* Compare the candidates responsibilities with Company requirements
* Duration of the assignments corresponding to the target role.
* Consistency between the key skills listed and the candidate's responsibilities mentioned in the CV.
* Relevance of the certificates received.


***When reviewing the CV:***

* Ignore all adjectives.
* Pay attention to the work the candidate performed and the goals achieved rather than to the companies, projects, and roles.
* If the list of key technologies is too extensive, there is a big chance that the candidate has no expertise in most of them and many of them were used only once.
