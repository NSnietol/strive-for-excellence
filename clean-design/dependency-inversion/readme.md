# Dependency Inversion

"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions."

â€” Robert C. Martin, Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices


High-level modules : contain the important policy decisions and business models of the application.

Low-level modules : contain detailed implementations of individual mechanisms needed to realize the policy.
