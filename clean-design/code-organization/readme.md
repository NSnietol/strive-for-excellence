# Organization of classes and modules


There may be different reasons for you to group classes together.

- Classes are part of one feature and serve the same idea.
- Classes do something specific in a similar way, so it is logical to group them together.
- Classes are intended to work with the same third-party code.


## Effective code organization.

- Readability : Easy to read for many but no for just ones.
- Modularity : is a key characteristic of organized code, and it is also connected to dependencies between modules.
- Reusability : leads to increased productivity and better code quality.


Ask questions that help you design classes and modules effectively, including questions about grouping, splitting, and placement.
