# Objects vs Data structures.


* ## Objects

All objects have two characteristics - stage and behavior. They store their states in *fields*, which are not observable from the outside and interact with other objects via *methods*.

* ## Data structures

Act as containers of structure data, don't have behavior just hold data to be used.


“Data structures expose their data and have no meaningful functions.”
“Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data.”
