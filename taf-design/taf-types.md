# Test automation frameworks Types

* **Record and playback** : Run and get scenarios, don't required IT knowledge For instance Katalon, Selenium IDE. Fast to get up and runnng vs Image dependent, not scalable, not configurable.

* **Scripts** : are built with programming lenguages and don't have much structure, reusability is no achived. Fast way to automate at first vs Poor readability, code duplication and not scalable.

* **Keyword - Driven** : it  divides test cases into differents parts as test steps, objects of test, actions on test steps and data for steps. Take information from source and based on keyword(actions) execute it, QA Automate tests along with test plan vs Keywords affects many tests, hard to manage. Keyword( Action), Application Map( UI Component), Component Function ( Minupulate the UI).

* **Data - Driven** : While Test Case logic resides in Test Scripts, the Test Data is separated and kept outside the Test Scripts. _Drawbacks and plus_ :  Automate a lot of test cases with single scenario vs hard to keep data consistency

* **Behavior - Driven** : software development approach that allows the tester/business analyst to create test cases in simple text language (English)  _Drawbacks and plus_ : Businnes and domain orietend, clean reporting vs Required consolidation, maintainability.
