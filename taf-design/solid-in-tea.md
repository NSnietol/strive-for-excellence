 The utilization of SOLID Principles in Automation Framework 

ðŸ”¹Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
Implementing a separate test case class for each specific functionality or feature being tested, such as LoginTestCase, RegistrationTestCase, or PaymentTestCase. Each test case class focuses on a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and maintain.

ðŸ”¹Open-Closed Principle (OCP):
Creating a test automation framework that allows new test cases to be added without modifying existing code. This could involve designing test case classes with extension points, such as hooks or customizable behavior, that can be leveraged by new test cases without altering the existing framework implementation.

ðŸ”¹Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Ensuring that any derived test case classes can be used interchangeably with the base test case class without impacting the correctness or behavior of the test suite. This allows for flexibility in adding new test cases or modifying existing ones while maintaining the overall integrity of the test suite.

ðŸ”¹Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Designing specific interfaces for different types of tests, such as WebTestInterface, APItestInterface, or PerformanceTestInterface. Each interface focuses on the requirements and capabilities specific to that type of test, avoiding the inclusion of unnecessary methods or functionalities for individual test cases.

ðŸ”¹Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
Using dependency injection to decouple the test automation framework from specific implementations or external dependencies. By relying on abstractions and injecting dependencies through interfaces, the framework becomes more flexible and adaptable to changes in underlying implementations or testing tools.
