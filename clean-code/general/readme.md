## Good scenarios

- Legal comments 
- Informative : a comment that explains the value of an abstract method
- TODO comment.

### _The only good comment is the comment you found a way not to write!_
  

## Bad cases

 - Bad code 
 - Redundant comments
 - Closing brace comments
 - Commented out code
 - Noise comments
 - Incorrect comments
 - Journaling comments



# DRY and WET

- DRY - Don't repeat your self : it's focused on reducing the duplication of information.

- WET - Write every time : causes the need to write code repeatedly due to maintenance and reusability challenges.

## Common duplications

- Imposed duplication 
- Inadvertent duplication: Happends when devs don't realize they're duplicating information.
- Impatient duplicaction: devs are realized of duplication but leave it because of lack of time or just laziness.
- Interdeveloper duplication : multiple peoplein a team duplicate information


## Error handling 

- Find the foot of the error 
- Include relevant error details
- Handle errors properly
- Use exceptions instead of codes

## Code Quality Metrics

- Cyclomatic complexity 
- Duplicate code percentage
- Code coverage
- Coupling between objects 
- Static code rules complaince
- Code comments percentage
- Lack of cohesion in methods 
- Unit test percentage
- Technical Debt
