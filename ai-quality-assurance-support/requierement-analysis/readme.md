# Key activities of the requirement analysis phase

- Identify testable requirements
- Clarify requirements
- Identify test types
- Establishing testing priorities
- Requirement traceability Matrix (RTM) preparation
- Test environment setup
- Automation feasibility analysis


## Identifying testable requirements

Conversational AI tools can support quality engineers in analyzing both functional and non-functional project requirements.

- Prepare a high-level unified strategy for analyzing project requirements to discuss with the testing team.
- Analyze a software requirement and suggest the appropriate testing strategy.

## Clarifying requirements

Generative AI can be a valuable assistant in analyzing requirements by uncovering potential gaps or inconsistencies in documentation.

- Preparation for refinement session

## Identifying test types
Conversational AI tools like ChatGPT can recommend suitable test types for a specific project, considering multiple factors such as the project's scope, complexity, and risks associated with the software under development.

- Identifying Non-Functional Testing Types for the project

## Establishing testing priorities

AI tools can help quality engineers determine which areas of the software require more significant attention and prioritize the various tests accordingly

- Prioritizing testing activities : Analyze project requirements and prioritize testing activities based on the risk associated with the software under development.

## Requirement traceability Matrix (RTM) preparation
Maps the relationships between requirements, test cases, and other project artifacts, ensuring a clear understanding of requirement test coverage and enabling more effective test planning.

## Test environment setup

- Key considerations for establishing a robust test environment : Analyze factors that influence the test environment setup and suggest a suitable test environment setup strategy.

## Automation feasibility analysis

- Identifying benefits and potential challenges of test automation : Analyze project requirements and suggest the feasibility of test automation based on the project's scope, complexity, and risks associated with the software under development.
