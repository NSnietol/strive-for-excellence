# Optimizing test execution phase with AI support


## Defect tracking and reporting

- ### During the testing, an unexpected error occurred. Analyze logs and decide if it is an application bug.

    ``` 
    Please act as a developer. Analyze the logs below and suggest what might be the root cause of the issue and how to resolve it. Prepare the answer in a tabular format: Root Cause, Explanation, Steps to Fix.

- ### Analyze a regular expression that is used for IP white-listening.

    ```
    Act as a developer with solid knowledge of regular expressions.

    Analyze the code below:

    private static final String external_REGEX = "^(http|https):\\/\\/[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\/someapi\\/api\\/[a-zA-Z]+\\.some\\.company$";


    Provide the answer (passed or failed) of applying this regular expression to the URLs:

    http://example.com/someapi/api/system1.some.company
    http://example.com/someapi/api/system2.some.company
    http://example.com/someapi/api/system3.some.company
    http://example.test.com/someapi/api/system.some.company
    http://example.uat.com/someapi/api/system.some.company
    For each failed case, provide a short explanation.
    ```

- ### You are a newcomer and were assigned to retest the bug fix. Decide what to test except direct "steps to reproduce.

    ```
    Act as manual QA.
    I have fixed the bug:
    Summary: The user is unable to add items to the cart.
    Steps to Reproduce:
    Navigate to the product page.
    Select a product.
    Click the "Add to Cart" button.
    Expected Result: The selected product should be added to the cart, and the cart's item count should increment by one.

    Actual Result: The product is not being added to the cart, and the item count remains unchanged.

    Please prepare guidance on retesting the defect. Provide the answer as a textual description with numbered bullets.
    ```

  - ### As a test team lead, prepare up-to-date information about all logged for-the-day defects by the evening sync with the client.
  ```
  Act as a Lead QA who needs to be prepared for the evening status call with the client. The team uses JIRA, and the client is interested in all defects-related changes (new defects, status updates, etc.).

  Please suggest how I can be prepared. Is it possible to use any dashboards, auto emailing, etc.?
  ```

- ### Create a skeleton of the bug using a test case as a context.

    ``` Please act as a manual QA with experience in JIRA API.

    Consider the test case below and write a bug report for the actual behavior.


    Test Case:

    Go to the application main page and click the talent management tab
    Choose a Tribe where two or more Squads -> drag-and-drop. any employee to the different squad with statuses (Pending, Open, Onboarding, Assigned, Waiting for approval, or Rejected)

    Expected result:

    The user is able to add to the new squad, and the employee is automatically removed from its previous location. The data on the card is updated in real time when the card is moved to a new squad.
    Employees with statuses Pending, Open, Onboarding, Assigned, Waiting for approval, or Rejected - can be drag-and-dropped between squads

    Actual behavior: when Employee has the status "Closed," it's not displayed on the board.


    Provide the answer in a JSON format for JIRA. Use Jira REST API documentation
