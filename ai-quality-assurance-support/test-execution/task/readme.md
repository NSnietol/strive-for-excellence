Task Description
Imagine that you are a testing engineer and need to test a textbox designed for recording client phone numbers.

The user interface of this textbox looks as follows:



Here is the list of rules for the textbox:

R1. A three-symbol country code is obligatory (examples include: 001, 049, etc.).

R2. A three-symbol area code is obligatory (examples include: 001, 049, etc.).

R3. Dashes and whitespaces are not allowed to enter (they are implemented as a part of the visualization).

R4. Optional Extension Support is allowed (for example, x 123).


During the testing process, you've discovered that inputting an extension is not feasible.

The code implementation for the rule is as follows:

String phoneNumberRegex = "\\+\\d{1,3}\\s*\\(\\d{3}\\)\\s*\\d{3}-\\d{4}$";
Use ChatGPT to analyze the regular expression above and identify other potentially hidden defects (Note: This regular expression contains more than one defect). Then, prepare a defect report documenting your testing findings.
