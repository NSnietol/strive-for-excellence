A three-symbol country code is obligatory (examples include: 001, 049, etc.).\nR2. A three-symbol area code is obligatory (examples include: 001, 049, etc.).\nR3. Dashes and whitespaces are not allowed to enter (they are implemented as a part of the visualization).\nR4. Optional Extension Support is allowed (for example, x 123).\nThe output should have rule being broken, an example, and a description of it come up with at least 5 if possible. Additional, I ask you do not add any new rules, niether assume anything outside of this. \n",

          "content": "Based on the provided rules, here are 5 issues with the provided regex:\n\n1. The regex \"\\d{1,3}\" for the country code allows for a country code of length one, two, or three. But as per rule R1, a three-symbol country code is obligatory. \n    - Example: \"+1 (123) 456-7890\" \n    - Description: The country code \"1\" has only 1 digit while according to R1, it should have 3.\n\n2. Second, the regex \"\\\\s*\" between the country code and the area code, and also the regex \"\\\\s*\" between the area code and the phone number allows whitespaces, which is against rule R3 that states that dashes and whitespaces are not allowed.\n    - Example: \"+001 (123) 456 -7890\"\n    - Description: The password contains whitespaces which is against the R3 rule.\n\n3. The regex does not remove dashes \"-\" as per rule R3.\n    - Example: \"+001(123)456-7890\"\n    - Description: The password contains dashes which is against the R3 rule.\n\n4. The regex does not support optional extension as per rule R4.\n    - Example: \"+001(123)4567890x123\"\n    - Description: The password contains a valid extension which is allowed by R4, but it is not supported by the regex.\n\n5. The regex assumes the phone number is placed in parenthesis \" \\\\(\\\\d{3}\\\\) \". This condition isn't mentioned in the rules.\n    - Example: \"+0011234567890\"\n    - Description: According to the rules, the phone number format \"+0011234567890\" is valid, but the regex did not match with this format.",
