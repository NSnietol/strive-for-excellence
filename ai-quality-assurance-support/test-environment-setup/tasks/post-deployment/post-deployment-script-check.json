          "content": "Here is an example of a simple bash script to handle this problem:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Specifying the parent directory path\nbasePath=\"/path/to/your/directory\"\n\n# Generate the list of files along with their details\nfunction list_files() {\n  if [ -d $1 ]\n  then\n    for file in $1/*\n    do\n      if [ -d $file ]\n      then\n        list_files $file\n      elif [ -f $file ]\n      then\n        # Print file details\n        echo \"Directory: $(dirname $file)\"\n        echo \"File: $(basename $file)\"\n        # Print file size in human-readable format (e.g., KB, MB)\n        echo \"Size: $(du -sh $file | cut -f1)\"\n        \n        echo \"--------------------------------------\"\n      fi\n    done\n  else\n    echo \"$1 is not a directory\"\n  fi\n}\n\n# Call the function to list files\nlist_files $basePath\n```\n\nSave this to a .sh file and replace the `basePath` variable with the path to your desired directory. Then, run the script in a Linux terminal or any other Bash environment. The script will recursively examine all directories and output the directory name, file name, and file size for each file it encounters.\n\nThis script does not explicitly check if a deployment succeeded, but could be modified to do so by comparing the outputted file list to a record of what should be present after a successful deployment. You could also add error check mechanisms based on file permissions, timestamp, content verification, etc., depending on your specific requirements. Remember to make the script executable (`chmod +x scriptname.sh`).",

Please provide a valid directory path.\"\n  fi\n}\n\nlist_files $basePath\n```\n\nIn this modified version, the script first checks if the `DIRECTORY_PATH` environment variable is set. If it's not, the script will print an error message and stop executing.  \n\nTo run the script, first set the DIRECTORY_PATH environment variable in the terminal as shown below:\n\n```shell\nexport DIRECTORY_PATH=/path/to/your/directory\n```\n\nAfter that run the script in your terminal:\n\n```shell\n./script.sh\n```\n\nThe script will now use the DIRECTORY_PATH environment variable as the directory to check.",
