It's application to format text, enhances its readability.\n\n\nThe Story:\nAs a user, I want to be able to format text, enhancing its readability.\nAvailable formatting features are as follows (The image provided illustrates these features):\n\nAlignment: Left, Right, Centered, Justified, Distributed\nLeft Indentation: Positive, 0, Negative\nRight Indentation: Positive, 0, Negative\nSpecial: Hanging, First Line\nBy: Positive, 0, Negative",

However, it lacks certain clarifications.\n\n1. Image mentioned in the story is missing. We need it to understand the exact requirements.\n2. Input text format is not specified. We need to know whether it's plain text, rich text,RDF etc.\n3. The output or the supported file formats are also not specified.\n4. No specific details on the 'Special' formatting features.\n5. There is no information about what 'By: Positive, 0, Negative' implies.\n   \nOnce these gaps are filled, we can go ahead with a more comprehensive list. Nonetheless, following are some basic Test Cases we can frame:\n   \nTest Cases:\n\n1. Verify that the 'Alignment' option works and aligns the text Left, Right, Centered, Justified, Distributed.\n2. Verify that 'Left Indentation' changes the Indentation of the text on the Left to Positive, 0, Negative.\n3. Verify 'Right Indentation' changes the Indentation of the text on the Right to Positive, 0, Negative.\n4. Verify the 'Special' formatting feature provides Hanging and First Line options.\n5. Verify how text behaves when 'By' option is chosen and set it to Positive, 0, Negative.\n6. Verify that the application supports different input text formats.\n7. Verify that the application supports different output file formats.\n8. Verify the application can format a sizeable amount of text without degradation in performance.\n9. Verify the formatted text is readable and compares with the expected output as per requirements.\n10. Verify undo and redo functionality after applying formatting.\n11. Verify the application's response when incorrect / unsupported values are provided in indentation values.\n12. Verify that the application retains its last used settings when reopened.\n13. Verify that the saved format can be successfully loaded the next time the application is opened.",
