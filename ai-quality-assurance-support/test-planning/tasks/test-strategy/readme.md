This task requires you to engage with ChatGPT to prepare the 'Environments' section of a test strategy document for a reference project. The resulting output should be structured in a table with the following columns: Environment, Address(es), Purpose, and Data.

Here are the rules for populating this table:

The 'Data' column should indicate the specifics of the data (production data, prod-obfuscated for UAT, or created for testing purposes).
The 'Purpose' column needs to detail the environment's purpose and types of tests planned to be performed and specify whether usage of the environment is mandatory or optional.

Acceptance Criteria
Below are the acceptance criteria:

The prompts to ChatGPT should be well-structured and clearly define the output format (table).
The prompts should provide guidelines for completing the 'Data' and 'Purpose' columns.
The number of environments specified should be reasonable (at least four).
