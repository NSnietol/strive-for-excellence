This test covers all the functions provided by the application. |\n| Integration Test  | High     | This is critical to guarantee the communication between different modules such as the booking system, payment portal, and user account management. |\n| Performance Test  | Medium   | This is done to ensure the application can handle peak load times, e.g., during holidays when demand is high. |\n| Security Test     | High     | It is very important to ensure the security of the user data and payment details. |\n| User Interface Test | Medium  | It checks the application's interactive aspects, like visual elements, navigation, and user input-output handling. |\n\nOut of Scope:\n\n| Test Type | Justification of exclusion |\n|---------  |----------------------------|\n| Hardware Compatibility Test | The application is platform-specific and designed for mobile devices. Testing on other hardware types would not provide significant value. |\n| Database Stress Test   | The database used by the application is managed by a third party service. Therefore, stress testing is beyond the control and scope of this project. |\n| Localization Test   | Currently the application is only available in English thus localization testing is not applicable. |\n| Manual Regression Testing | Due to the high number of minor iterations and the agile workflow, it's time-consuming and unproductive. Automation of regression testing is thus preferred. |\n",
